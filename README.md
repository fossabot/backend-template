This project aims to provide a template for building production-grade backend system running on NodeJS. I think this is suitable for one who grew up in a transition period between Rails-era to JavaScript-era. [I][MPJ] learned partly at work as junior engineer maintaining MVC-like app written in Rails or Spring, but I also partly influenced on JavaScript-hype happen around 2017. This template will be biased towards my experience building information system using those technologies.
